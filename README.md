Project Difficulties

I was very unsure on the loading and saving system. I wanted to originally do this with system preferences but the
sprites that my items contained made it more complicated. The main menu that I created has a cyclical setup so it doesn't crash
any build that uses it, but there is no real saving/loading system.
